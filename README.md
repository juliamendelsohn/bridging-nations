# Bridging Nations: Quantifying the Role of Multilinguals in Communication on Social Media
Code, data, and models for the ICWSM 2023 paper "Bridging Nations: Quantifying the Role of Multilinguals in Communication on Social Media"

Notes:
- Full datasheets for causal inference studies are too large to be uploaded to GitHub (>1TB for all studies and country pair networks). If you would like access to these datasheets, please contact the authors directly at juliame@umich.edu.
- The trained contextualized topic model was too large to load to GitHub and instead can be found on HuggingFace here: https://huggingface.co/juliamendelsohn/contextual-topic-model-bridging-nations
